## Key Features

* **Multi-Tab Workspace**: Open and manage multiple concurrent SSH shell terminal sessions in a tabbed workspace.
* **Console Output Colorizer**: Real-time log parsing highlights critical keywords like `error`, `fail`, and `critical` (Red), `warning` and `warn` (Orange), and `success` / `ok` (Green) automatically across compound and standalone words.
* **SFTP File Explorer (WinSCP-like)**:
  * Dual-mode session: Switch between **Console** and **Files (SFTP)** tabs on the fly.
  * Graphical file explorer with navigation, parent directories, breadcrumb paths, and folders sorted first.
  * Full file operations: create folders, rename files/directories, and delete items.
  * Drag-and-Drop files directly from your desktop file manager to upload.
  * Real-time transfer progress bars with speed ratios and active transfer cancellation.
* **Clipboard Interoperability**:
  * **Highlight-to-Copy**: Highlighted terminal output is automatically copied to your system clipboard.
  * **Right-Click Paste**: Right-click paste support to transfer text from your clipboard directly into active PTY commands.
* **Encrypted Credential Storage**: Encrypts connection profiles locally using AES-256-CBC with a secure host key. Profiles are stored in compliance with Linux desktop standards under `~/.config/OmicronSSH/`.
* **Automatic Window Resize**: Synchronizes PTY terminal rows/columns automatically via WebSocket whenever the window size changes.

## Tech Stack

* **Frontend**: React, Vite, Vanilla CSS (Glassmorphism layout system), `xterm.js` for canvas-based shell rendering.
* **Backend**: Node.js, Express, `ws` (WebSockets), `ssh2` (Pure Javascript SSH & SFTP fallback tunnel client).
* **Desktop Wrapper**: Electron (packaged into AppImage and Debian formats).
